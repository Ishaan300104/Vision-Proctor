# Labels folder

This folder should contain your training data labels in where there would be 3 different classes namely:-
1. speaking or laughing (WARNING!)
2. looking at screen or thinking (normal)
3. covering mouth (WARNING!)

It also contains one classes.txt file that contains the name of classes that I've used.

Filename should be of the format: <label>.<imagename>.png
