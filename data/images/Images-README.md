# Images folder

This folder should contain your training data which is basically your photos in which there would be 3 different classes namely:-
1. speaking or laughing (WARNING!)
2. looking at screen or thinking (normal)
3. covering mouth (WARNING!)

In my case, I've used 15*3 = 45 images for the training YOLOv5s model

Filename should be of the format: <label>.<imagename>.png
